# Scraping-Wikipedia-Table-in-python

Hello Amigos,

New to Webscraping???? 

This article teaches you how to scrape wikipedia data. Since it is a beginner lesson, 
we will only scrape the data present in one table of a wikipedia page. In this particular example I wanted to take a look at the College Endowment trends.

I hope this short and crsip code will help you understand how a scraper works and extracts information.

Enjoy!
